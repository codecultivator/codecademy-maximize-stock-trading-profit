## Maximize Stock Trading Profit
Given the daily values of a stock, create a function called maxProfitDays() that, given a list of integers, will return the index value of the two elements that represent the day on which one should have bought a share and the day on which one should have sold a share based on the max profit.

A list of integers will represent the stock price at the beginning or “opening bell” of each day for a week. You are required to buy and sell only once. You also must buy a stock before selling it.

For example, given the list [17, 11, 60, 25, 150, 75, 31, 120], you can assume that index 0 represents day 0 and index 7 represents day 7. In this case, purchasing on day 1 and selling on day 4 would yield the most profit. If we were to call maxProfitDays([17, 11, 60, 25, 150, 75, 31, 120]), the function would return [1, 4].

This challenge was reported to have been asked at interviews with Google and Amazon. If you’ve covered the material in Pass the Technical Interview with JavaScript or an equivalent, you should be able to solve this challenge.
